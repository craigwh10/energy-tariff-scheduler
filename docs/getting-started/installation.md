# Installation

First check that you have python installed on your machine:

```sh
python -v
```

If you do not then follow [this guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your preferred manager such as [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python).

Given now you have python installed, use the following command to install the dependency on your machine (or in a virtual environment).

```sh
pip install domestic-tariff-scheduler-sdk
```
