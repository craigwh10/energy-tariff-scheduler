most recent tariff, gets the tariff code for it and then tries its best to match the closest product code from the current active products provided by Octopus (where they are non-business type and within Octopus brand), here it's assumed that the product code contains as many characters as possible in the tariff code, such as if your tariff code is <code>E-1R-AGILE-FLEX-22-11-25-C</code> if a product doesn't exist for this it may match <code>AGILE-24-10-01</code>.</p> <p>Obviously this isn't foolproof and a big assumption has been made here so expect it to fail, and if it does please raise
